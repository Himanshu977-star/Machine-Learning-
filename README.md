🔥 Machine Learning (ML) Overview
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

🚀 Types of Machine Learning
1️⃣ Supervised Learning (Labeled Data)
The model learns from labeled training data, meaning input-output pairs are provided.
🔹 Examples:

📈 Regression (Predicting continuous values) – House Price Prediction
🔍 Classification (Predicting categories) – Email Spam Detection
🔹 Popular Algorithms:

Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks

2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning (No Labels)
The model learns patterns from unlabeled data without predefined categories.
🔹 Examples:

📊 Clustering – Customer Segmentation
⚖ Dimensionality Reduction – Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
🔹 Popular Algorithms:

K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA, Autoencoders

3️⃣ Reinforcement Learning (Rewards & Punishments)
The model learns by interacting with an environment and maximizing rewards over time.
🔹 Examples:

🏎️ Self-driving Cars
🤖 Robotics
🎮 AlphaGo playing chess
🔹 Popular Algorithms:

🛠️ Key Components of ML
✅ Dataset – Collection of training examples
✅ Features – Important variables used for prediction
✅ Model – The mathematical function mapping inputs to outputs
✅ Loss Function – Measures prediction errors
✅ Optimization Algorithm – Adjusts model weights (e.g., Gradient Descent)
Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

🏗️ Machine Learning Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing
2️⃣ Feature Engineering (Selecting important features)
3️⃣ Model Selection (Choosing the right ML algorithm)
4️⃣ Training the Model (Fitting data to the model)
5️⃣ Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning
6️⃣ Deployment & Continuous Improvement

⚡ Popular ML Libraries & Tools
🔹 Python – Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
🔹 R – caret, mlr3
🔹 Cloud Platforms – AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, IBM Watson
